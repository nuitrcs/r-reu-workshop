# Data Information

These exercises use the data file gov_env_2015.csv. This data set includes environmental and government data on 150+ countries for 2015. The original data comes from <https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data>, but variables have been renamed and some values may have been changed.

Each row in the data set is a country-year observation.

Variables:

-   **country**: name of the country
-   **region**: region that the country is in
-   **population**
-   **electoral_comp**: categorical measure of what type of elections a country has:
    0.  No elections
    1.  Single-party elections
    2.  Non-democratic multi-party elections
    3.  Democratic elections
-   **globalization**: a scale of economic, political, and social globalization with a theoretical range of 1 to 100. Higher values indicate greater globalization.
-   **monarchy**: binary indicator of whether a country is a monarchy (monarchy = 1)
-   **presidential**: binary indicator of whether a country is a presidential system (presidential = 1)
-   **democracy**: binary indicator of whether a country is a democracy (democracy = 1)
-   **gdp_per_capita**: real GDP per capita in 2011 US dollars
-   **rain_avg**: average annual rainfall in mm
-   **temp_avg**: average annual temperature in degrees Celsius
-   **climate_laws_policies**: number of climate change laws and policies enacted
-   **co2_per_capita**: CO2 emissions in metric tons per capita
-   **co2_growth_rate**: adjusted rate of growth in CO2 emissions
-   **ag_land_pct**: % of land used for agriculture
-   **forest_land_pct**: % of land that is forest
-   **nat_disaster_damage**: estimated damage from natural disasters, in thousands of US dollars
-   **nat_disaster_affected**: number of people affected by natural disasters
-   **nat_disaster_deaths**: number of deaths from natural disasters
-   **nat_disaster_n**: number of natural disasters

# Overview

These exercises cover the data visualization concepts discussed in the workshop. The goal is for you to be able to complete these tasks independently by the end of the workshop.

Challenge exercises typically require multiple steps or putting together concepts in a way not directly demonstrated in the workshop materials.

# Exercises

## Exercise: Import the Data

Create a new R script file and save the file.

Add code to your script to import the `gov_env_2015.csv` file. Make sure to assign the data a name.

Make sure to load any libraries you might need for these exercises.

## Exercise: Examine Variable Distributions with Histograms

Make a histogram of rain_avg. Change the number of bins/breaks. Add a title and set the axis labels appropriately.

Make a histogram of temp_avg just for Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Exercise: Examine Variable Distributions with Bar Plots

Make a bar plot of climate_laws_policies.

Make a bar plot of monarchy status just for democracies.

Challenge: Change the labels for the bar plot of monarchy to be "Monarchy" and "Not Monarchy" instead of 0 and 1.

## Exercise: Visualize Groups with Color

Make a scatterplot of forest_land_pct and rain_avg. Color the points by region.

## Exercise: Visualize Groups with Facets

Make a histogram of globalization. Create facets of the plot by democracy.

Challenge: Change the facet labels to be "Democracy" and "Not Democracy" instead of 0 and 1.
