## Introduction

Welcome to R for Complete Beginners! In this workshop, we're going to cover:

-   The components of RStudio
-   Basics of the R console
-   Calling functions
-   The assignment operator
-   Getting help
-   Working directory
-   Importing a dataset
-   Installing and loading packages
-   Creating and running a script with R code
-   Comments
-   Vectors
-   Missing values
-   R help/documentation
-   RStudio Projects

To be fair, this first session can be a little bit boring; but it's really important. There's a lot of foundational stuff to cover before we actually start working with data. If, throughout today, you're wondering how this all works for analyzing your data, the simple answer is that it doesn't directly. We won't be working with a dataset today. After many years of seeing people jump in and start working with a data set and someone else's code in R, I've found that it's worth it to go through the basics first. We'll start working with datasets (via data frames) in the next workshop.

## RStudio panel layout

The RStudio user interface has 4 primary panes:

-   **Source** pane

-   **Console** pane

-   **Environment** pane, containing the **Environment**, **History**, **Connections**, **Build**, **VCS** , and **Tutorial** tabs

-   **Output** pane, containing the **Files**, **Plots**, **Packages**, **Help**, **Viewer**, and **Presentation** tabs

Each pane can be minimized or maximized within the column by clicking the minimize/maximize buttons ![The min-max button which shows a collapsed or expanded Window.](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/images/min-max.png){alt="The min-max button which shows a collapsed or expanded Window." width="25" height="14"}.

## Let's get our hands dirty with code!

R is a very powerful tool for scientific analysis and data visualization. Let's suppose that you are a penguin researcher, and you have collected data from different species of penguins by measuring their anatomical features such as flipper length, body mass, beak size etc. Now you want to investigate if bill length and bill depth are related to each other.

![](images/culmen_depth_modified.png){width="476"}

Copy the code below and execute it in the console to find out!

```{r, plot1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)

install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

bill_len_dep <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                         aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                             y = bill_depth_mm,
                             group = species)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, 
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(color = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin bill dimensions",
       subtitle = "Bill length and depth for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")

bill_len_dep + theme_bw()
```

## Console and R Commands

We can type basic math equations in the console. Click Run Code to give it a try.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
2+2
3^2
(2+3)/(5+7)
```

```{r, math1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

We can also do Boolean comparisons -- expressions that result in TRUE or FALSE

-   == for testing equality
-   ! means NOT
-   & is AND, \| is OR

```{r, math2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
3 > 2
5 == 25/5
"cat" != "dog"
!TRUE
```

```{r, math3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE | FALSE
```

### Tips

-   There's a space after the prompt (`>`)
-   If you see a `+` instead of a `>`, R thinks the previous command wasn't finished and expects more input
    -   If you're stuck with a `+`, you can use Control+C or the escape (esc) key to cancel the command and get the normal `>` prompt back.
-   Use the up and down arrow keys to cycle through previous commands
    -   List of previous commands is in the History tab in RStudio (with the Environment tab)
-   Output starts with `[1]`; this number indexes the output values, since there can be more than one value as output

### EXERCISE

Type some math equations in the console. Lacking inspiration? What's the square root of 394, minus 5, cubed? How many years have people in your family been alive together? What year was someone who just turned 93 born? What's the area of a circle with radius 5 (hint: R knows `pi`)?

```{r, math4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Functions

Functions have a name. They optionally take one or more input values (arguments). They optionally return a value (or a more complicated object) or have a side effect (do something).

Examples: log, round

You can nest function calls:

```{r, func1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
log(16)
round(2.12345)
round(log(16))
```

How do you learn function names? See the [R Reference Card](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Baggott-refcard-v2.pdf) for some basics. Otherwise, look at the documentation for the packages you're using, or tutorials for the type of analysis you want to do.

The inputs or arguments to a function have names. When we don't use the name, like above, it matches the values in order. But we can always use the argument name:

```{r, func2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
round(3.1415, digits=2)
```

You can find the argument names in the Help or documentation page for the function. We'll look at these soon.

## Variables

We save and reference individual values, or more complex objects like vectors and data sets, with variables. We assign values to a name.

```{r, var1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- 3
```

```{r, var2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x = 3
```

The `<-` assignment operator is recommended for clarity. `=` also works, but because we use `=` for named arguments when we call functions, it can be confusing.

You can see the value of a variable by typing the name in the console and hitting enter. A variable name by itself is a valid R command.

Variable names are case sensitive. `X` and `x` are different names.

Everything on the right-hand side of an assignment operator is evaluated first, then the result is saved to the name on the left:

```{r, var3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```

### EXERCISE

The `runif()` function produces random numbers from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. `runif(1)` produces 1 random value. Save the result of calling this function to a variable. Then type the variable name in the console to see the value.

```{r, var4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Spacing

You can put spaces almost anywhere in R (Exception: not between multi-character operators like `<-`).

You can break up an R command on multiple lines as long as the partial lines aren't complete R commands. This means it's best to put line breaks within `()` or after an operator that has a right-hand side (e.g. `+`) so R knows there's more input.

All OK:

```{r, space1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
round(3.1415, digits=2)

round(3.1415, digits = 2)

round(3.1415, 
      digits=2)

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 +  
  11 + 12

x<-3

x <- 3
```

Works but bad style (don't write code like this):

```{r, space2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
round     (1.2345)

x <- 
  3
```

Doesn't work:

```{r, space3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
2 + 2 
/ 3

runif
(1)

x < - 3  # tests if x is less than -3, not an assignment
```

## Environment

When we make variables, they show up in the Environment tab. The Environment tab has the variables and objects that you create, so you can check there to verify what R knows about).

Data sets, variables, and objects in R are held in memory. This means that the data size limits of R are based on the limits of RAM on the computer you are using. On most relatively recent laptops, you generally won't have an issue until your datasets start to approach around 1GB in size.

### Help

"Help" is a bit of a misnomer for the R Help. It is documentation that gives you information on different functions and packages. It is really only useful if you already know the name of the function you want to use. It's not an effective way to search for a function to do what you want.

You can open a documentation page by typing at the console:

```{r, help1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
?round
```

Or use the search box on the Help tab. Look at the usage section to see function arguments and their default values. Arguments that don't have `=` and a value after them are required. Those with `=` have a default value that will be used if you don't specify something different.

Below Usage is a list of arguments with more detailed descriptions.

### Files

You can use the Files tab to access the files on your computer.

### Working Directory

Working directory: Where R starts looking for files on your computer.

You can set it or go to it in the Files pane (under the More menu), or with functions.

```{r, wd1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
getwd()
setwd("r-reu-workshop/")  # this is an example -- file path needs to be valid
```

### EXERCISE

Make the folder on your computer with the files for this workshop (what you downloaded) the working directory. Use the `setwd()` function or navigate to the folder in the Files window and then choose Set As Working Directory from the More menu. Then test that you're in the right place by running `list.files()` in the console. `dataframes.Rmd` should be listed among the results, as should a `data` folder.

```{r, help2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Reading in (Importing) Data

There are special functions for importing data.

```{r, read1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv("data/evanston_schools.csv")
my_data
```

Here, there's a data folder inside my working directory, that has the data file in it. It reads the CSV file in as a data frame, which we'll learn about in the next workshop. I'm giving the data frame a name, `my_data`, which is just like what we did creating variables above.

### View your data

`View()` is a useful function to view your data. Try it as below!

```{r, read2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
View(my_data)
```

### EXERCISE

Read in (import) the `ev_police_jan.csv` data file that's in the data directory, and view it.

Note: Evanston police data comes from the [Stanford Open Policing Project](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/).

```{r, read3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Vectors

Vectors hold multiple values (all of the same type). Create a vector with the `c()` function:

```{r, vec1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 4, 6, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4)
x
```

### Accessing the elements

Access elements of the vector using an index for the position. First element is at position 1.

```{r, vec2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
x[1]
```

If you go beyond the range of what's in the vector, you get `NA`, which is missing (see below), not an error:

```{r, vec3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
x[100]
```

So be careful!

So how do you know how long a vector is?

```{r, vec4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
length(x)
```

To access a range of values, use a colon. The endpoints of the range are inclusive:

```{r, vec5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
x[1:3]
```

You can specify non-adjacent index positions by putting a vector inside []. Elements are returned in the order the index values appear:

```{r, vec6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
x[c(3, 1, 2)]
```

If you see a negative index value, it excludes the elements at those positions:

```{r, vec7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.setup = "vec1"}
x[-1:-4]
```

You can't mix positive and negative indices.

## EXERCISE

In the console or an open R Script file, make a vector called fav_numbers and put 5 numbers in it. Then write an expression to select just the 4th value from that vector. Hint: remember the `c()` function.

```{r, vec8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Vectors with Functions

Some functions take vectors as input and operate on each element.

```{r, vec9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
log(x)
```

Functions don't (generally) change their input values:

```{r, vec10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x  # still the same as before
```

Other functions take vectors as input and do something with the whole vector.

```{r, vec11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sum(x)
```

```{r, vec12, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
table(x)
```

With a table, the top line is the unique values, and the bottom line is the counts of each value.

```{r, vec13, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sort(x)
```

Note that like most other functions, the sort is just to the output -- the vector didn't change.

## Indexing with Boolean Values

We can use vectors in comparisons (boolean operators)

```{r, ind1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x > 3
```

TRUE and FALSE are important, because we can use them to select values from vectors -- the elements at positions that correspond to TRUE are selected

```{r, ind2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x[x > 3]
```

## EXERCISE

Run the code below to create the vector called y. Then write an expression to select the values from y that are less than .2

```{r, ind3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
y <- runif(20) # creates 20 random numbers
```

Bonus: Round the result of your expression above so that each value prints to 2 decimal places only.

## Missing Values

`NA` is the symbol for missing data; it can be used with any data type

```{r, mis1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
NA  
y <- c("dog", "cat", NA, NA, "bird")
x <- c(NA, 2, NA, 4, NA, 6, NA, 6, 6, 4)
is.na(x)  
```

A common operation is to count how many missing values there are in a vector. We use the function `is.na()` to get TRUE when the value is `NA` and FALSE otherwise. Then we sum that result; this works because TRUE converts to 1 and FALSE converts to 0. So it counts the number of missing values (the number of TRUEs).

```{r, mis2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
sum(c(TRUE, FALSE))
sum(is.na(x))  
```

Different functions handle missing values in different ways. Most commonly, you'll get an answer of `NA` unless you tell the function to remove or exclude the missing values in the calculation.

```{r, mis3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
mean(x)
mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)
```

## Using the R help

We're going to talk through the page for `read.csv()`.

### EXERCISE

Do the first part below where you're unfamiliar with the function

#### Part A : Table

The code below creates a vector with random letters in it.

```{r, hel1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
x <- sample(c(letters[1:10], NA, NA, NA), 100, TRUE)
```

Your job is to make a frequency table of the values in the vector (get the count of how many times each letter appears). Look at the help page for `table()` to figure out how to make a table that also includes the count of any missing values in the vector x.

Don't forget to run the code to create `x` before trying to make a table of it.

Bonus: after you do that, look up the help for the `sample()` function to see what's going on there :)

#### Part B : Quantile

Bonus if you have time: Use the `quantile()` function to find the 50th (0.5) and 95th (.95) quantiles of the w vector below. Look up the help for the function to see how to use it.

```{r, hel2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
w <- rnorm(100)
```

## Packages

It is expected that you will use multiple packages written by other people when using R.

You install packages once (for each major version of R). You load them each time you run R.

Install:

```{r, pkg1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
install.packages("praise", repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It's the primary place people upload their packages for others to use. Other common places you may install packages from are Bioconductor and GitHub.

```{r, pkg2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
library(praise)
```

In R files, which we're going to talk about next, you want to put your library load commands near the top so people know what packages are needed to run the code.

The packages tab has buttons to help you with installing packages. It also shows you which packages are installed, and which are loaded.

To update a package, you just install it again.

Some packages print messages when you load them:

```{r, pkg3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Code Files

So far, we've been typing in the console. But we want to write our R code in a file so we keep track of what we've done, and we can reproduce what we're doing. There are two main options for how to write your R code.

### R Script

We'll create a new file from the File menu or the new file button, and choose R Script.

This is a plain text file with a .R extension.

Everything in the file should be an R command -- no extra text or notes. Anything that isn't an R command should be a comment, which starts with `#`:

```{r, code1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# this is a comment
x <- 5  # this is also a comment
```

See the [`example_r_script.R`](example_r_script.R) file for an example. Here's what's in that file:

```{r, code=xfun::read_utf8("example_r_script.R"), eval=FALSE}
```

From a script file, you can send code to the console (you don't have to copy and paste it). You put your cursor in the line you want to run, then press the Command and Return keys (on a Mac) or Control and Return keys (for Windows). The cursor progresses to the next command after you hit Return.

The commands sent to the console are automatically executed.

If you highlight commands, it will send just what's highlighted.

### EXERCISE

-   Install the `fortunes` package (the code for this does NOT go in the script - just run it in the console)

-   Make a new R script.

-   In that script, load the `fortunes` package. Call the `fortune()` function from the package. Write the code to read in one of the data files we worked with before. (You can copy and paste the command to do this, or retype it.) Add a few other commands to your file.

-   Save your file.

    ```{r, code2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
    ```

### R Markdown

If you want to be able to write notes with your R code or add in analysis or any other text, you may want to use an R Markdown file instead of just an R script.

This file is an R Markdown file. It has the file extension .Rmd. It mixes plain text (with markdown formatting) and chunks of R code.

You can send code to the console from the R code chunks with the same commands you'd use in a R script

When the output appears under the code chunks, instead of in the console, it's often called an R Notebook.

Learn more about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## RStudio Projects and R Workflow

Part of using R successfully, and using R in a way that supports reproducible research, is keeping everything organized.

To do that, aim for a few good practices:

-   Put all of the files (scripts, data, output) for each project in a directory (folder) on your computer, separate from other projects.
-   Use relative file paths, not absolute ones, to refer to files. This allows you to move the directory or share it with someone else.
-   Don't change your raw data - it should not be overwritten. Read your data into R, change it in R, and then write a new copy of the data to a new file.
-   Separate data cleaning and analysis scripts. A common workflow is raw data \> data cleaning script in R \> write a new version of the data \> analysis scripts in R using the new data. This will help you keep track of the changes you make to the data, instead of having to re-run a bunch of exploratory analysis just to make sure you got all of the data cleaning steps run. You can also change your data cleaning script as needed, re-run it, and then re-run your analysis scripts on the newly changed data to keep everything in sync.
-   You should be able to re-run any R scripts from the beginning all the way through. This means that all commands for an analysis need to be in the script. You should be able to reproduce what you did yourself.
-   Don't save your R workspace. Change the setting in Tools \> Options menu (Windows) or RStudio \> Preferences (Mac)

RStudio projects help you do some of the above by setting the working directory for you and reminding you to keep related files together in a directory, separate from other projects. If you end up using version control like git in the future, RStudio projects also [coordinate well with git repositories](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/2022/05/11/git-with-rstudio-order-matters/).

## Working with Dataframes

Now that you are familiar with most of the basics, let's come back to the Penguin dataset we saw at the beginning. The data is from <https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins>. It's been included in an R package.

Install the `palmerpenguins` package and load it into the R workspace.

```{r, p1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

There's a data frame in the package called `penguins`. Like with functions in a package, we can use it once we've loaded the package with the library command above. View this dataframe.

```{r, p2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

Clicking on the name of the data frame in the environment tab will also open the viewer.

Dataframes have rows of observations and columns of features. How many rows and columns does this dataframe have? Let's find out below.

```{r, p3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
dim(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
```

Usually, the columns have names which denote the feature/variable being recorded. What are the column names for the `penguins` data?

```{r, p4, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
colnames(penguins)
names(penguins)
```

Rows can have names too, and you can see what they are as below.

```{r, p5, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
rownames(penguins)
```

### The `$` operator

Each column in a dataframe is essentially a vector. You can reference columns by their names using the `$` notation. Note how R helpfully displays the column names in this dataframe as soon as you add the `$` operator.

```{r, p6, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
penguins$species
```

You can also get the same output as above by indexing the dataframe. This time we put the column name in quotes inside square brackets.

```{r, p7, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
penguins[, "species"]
```

If you want to get back multiple columns, you can create a vector of column names.

```{r, p8, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
penguins[, c("island", "species")]
```

### EXERCISE

Using the `penguins` data frame:

-   Select the year column using `$` notation
-   Select the bill length and bill depth columns by name using `[]`

```{r, p9, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}

```

## Making new variables

We can add a new variable to the data frame by naming it with the `$` notation, and assigning a value to it. For example, make a variable that has flipper length in **centimeters (cm)** instead of **millimeters (mm)**

```{r, p10, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# make new variable: note CM instead of MM in the name
penguins$flipper_length_cm <- penguins$flipper_length_mm / 10

names(penguins)  # check to see that it was added
penguins[, c("flipper_length_cm", "flipper_length_mm")]  # select the two vars to view them
```

## EXERCISE

Now create a new column called `body_mass_kg` from the column `body_mass_g` that is the body mass in grams divided by 1000.

```{r, p11, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
```

## Day 1 complete!

Don't forget to practice the homework exercises in the `Practice_Day_1.R` file!
